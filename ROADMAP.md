# Roadmap for Nash Equilibrium Finder Project

## 1. **Project Setup and Basic Features**:
   - [x] Basic 2x2 matrix Nash Equilibrium computation (Pure Strategy).
   - [x] Command-line interface for user input and display of results.
   - [x] C++ implementation for efficient computation.
   
## 2. **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**:
   - [x] Implementation of mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium computation for 2x2 matrices.
   - [x] Visualization tool for displaying mixed strategy results.

## 3. **Dynamic Matrix Input**:
   - [x] Web-based GUI for inputting payoff matrices of any dimension.
   - [x] Backend server (Flask) for processing the matrices and returning results.
   - [x] Display of results in the GUI.

## 4. **Multiple Nash Equilibria**:
   - [x] Detection of multiple pure strategy Nash Equilibria in a given matrix.
   - [x] Display of all detected Nash Equilibria in the GUI.
   
## 5. **Advanced Game-Theoretic Computations**:
   - [ ] Implementation of more complex Nash Equilibrium strategies beyond pure and mixed strategies (e.g., Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, etc.).
   - [ ] Extend the project to compute Nash Equilibria in extensive form games (game trees).
   - [ ] Implement algorithms for finding subgame perfect Nash equilibria.
   
## 6. **Real-world Scenarios and Applications**:
   - [ ] Integration of real-world scenarios (e.g., prisoner's dilemma, battle of the sexes, auctions, etc.) with preset matrices for demonstration purposes.
   - [ ] Implementation of evolutionary game theory models to show how strategies evolve over time.
   
## 7. **Advanced User Interface and Visualization**:
   - [ ] Enhancements to the GUI to allow visualization of game-theoretic concepts (e.g., best response functions, strategy profiles, etc.).
   - [ ] Interactive tools for users to simulate and visualize how changes in payoff values affect equilibria.
   
## 8. **Documentation and User Guide**:
   - [x] Comprehensive README with project setup, usage, and feature descriptions.
   - [ ] Detailed user guide with explanations of game-theoretic concepts, strategies, and interpretations of results.
   - [ ] Inline documentation and comments for all code (both C++ and Python) for clarity and maintainability.
   
## 9. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - [ ] Development of unit tests for all computational modules.
   - [ ] Integration tests for the frontend-backend interaction.
   - [ ] User acceptance testing to ensure the system is intuitive and meets user needs.
   
## 10. **Deployment and Distribution**:
   - [ ] Packaging the project for easy installation and setup (e.g., Docker containerization).
   - [ ] Deployment of the web-based tool to a public server for broader access.
   - [ ] Consideration of open-sourcing the project for community contributions.
